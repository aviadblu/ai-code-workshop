## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: SSE over WebSocket — client never sends data
- Init: Canvas 2D over WebGL — 20k dots within Canvas limits
- Init: Zustand Map<id, Unit> — O(1) patching outside React tree
